=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<qof> is an IPFIX (B<RFC 7011>) flow meter with an emphasis on passive
TCP performance measurement. It is based on a fork of the B<yaf> flow meter.
It reads packet data using B<libtrace>, which allows it to read from many 
dumpfile formats as well as a variety of capture devices, generates flows 
from these packets, and exports flow records via IPFIX over SCTP, TCP or UDP,
or into B<RFC 5655> IPFIX Files on the local file system.

Since B<qof> is designed to be deployed on white-box sensors attached to local
network segments or span ports at symmetric routing points, it supports
bidirectional flow assembly natively. Biflow export is done via the export
method specified in B<RFC 5103> Bidirectional Flow Export using IPFIX. See the
B<OUTPUT> section below for information on this format.

As of this release, B<qof> is prerelease software. The command-line options,
configuration interface, and output format may change wildly before a 
1.0 release.

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 Input Options

These options control where B<qof> will take its input from.
=over 4

=item B<--in> I<LIBTRACE_URI>

I<LIBTRACE_URI> is a libtrace URI. If no scheme is given, 
assumes C<pcapfile:> to read from a named pcap dumpfile. 
If not given, reads pcap dumpfiles from standard input.

=item B<--filter> I<BPF_FILTER>

If present, enable Berkeley Packet Filtering (BPF) in B<qof> with I<FILTER_EXPRESSION> as the incoming traffic filter.  The syntax of I<FILTER_EXPRESSION> follows the expression format described in the B<tcpdump(1)> man page.

=back

=head2 Output Options

These options control where B<qof> will send its output. B<qof> can write flows
to an IPFIX file or export flows to an IPFIX collector over SCTP, TCP, UDP, or
Spread. By default, if no output options are given, B<qof> writes an IPFIX file
to standard output.

=over 4

=item B<--out> I<OUTPUT_SPECIFIER>

I<OUTPUT_SPECIFIER> is an output specifier. If B<--ipfix> is present,
the I<OUTPUT_SPECIFIER> specifies the hostname or IP address of the
collector to which the flows will be exported. Otherwise, I<OUTPUT_SPECIFIER> 
is a filename in which the flows will be written; the string B<-> 
may be used to write to standard output (the default).

=back

=item B<--ipfix> I<TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL>

If present, causes B<qof> to operate as an IPFIX exporter, sending
IPFIX Messages via the specified transport protocol to the collector (e.g.,
SiLK's rwflowpack or flowcap facilities) named in the I<OUTPUT_SPECIFIER>.
Valid I<TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL> values are B<tcp>, B<udp> or B<sctp>.
B<sctp> is only available if B<qof> was built with SCTP support. 
UDP is not recommended, as it is not a reliable transport protocol, 
and cannot guarantee delivery of messages.  As per the recommendations in 
RFC 5101, B<qof> will retransmit templates three times within the template 
timeout period (configurable using B<--template-refresh>). Use the
B<--ipfix-port>, B<--tls>, B<--tls-ca>, B<--tls-cert>, and B<--tls-key>
options to further configure the connection to the
IPFIX collector.

=item B<--rotate> I<ROTATE_DELAY>

If present, causes B<qof> to write output to multiple files, opening a new output
file every I<ROTATE_DELAY> seconds in the input data. Rotated files are named
using the prefix given in the I<OUTPUT_SPECIFIER>, followed by a suffix
containing a timestamp in C<YYYYMMDDhhmmss> format, a decimal serial number,
and the file extension B<.yaf>.

=item B<--lock>

Use lockfiles for concurrent file access protection on output files.
This is recommended for interoperating with the Airframe filedaemon
facility.

=item B<--stats> I<INTERVAL>

If present, causes B<qof> to export process statistics in an IPFIX Options
Record inline in the output stream every I<INTERVAL> seconds.
If I<INTERVAL> is set to zero, stats will not be exported; 
the default is not to export stats.

=back

=head2 IPFIX Connection Options

These options are used to configure the connection to an IPFIX collector.

=over 4

=item B<--ipfix-port> I<PORT>

If B<--ipfix> is present, export flows to TCP, UDP, or SCTP port I<PORT>.
If not present, the default IPFIX port 4739 is used. If B<--tls> is also
present, the default secure IPFIX port 4740 is used.

=item B<--tls>

If B<--ipfix> is present, use TLS to secure the connection to the
IPFIX collector. Requires the I<TRANSPORT_PROTOCOL> to be B<tcp>, as DTLS over
UDP or SCTP is not yet supported. Requires the B<--tls-ca>, B<--tls-cert>, and
B<--tls-key> options to specify the X.509 certificate and TLS key information.

=item B<--tls-ca> I<CA_PEM_FILE>

Use the Certificate Authority or Authorities in I<CA_PEM_FILE> to verify the
remote IPFIX Collecting Process' X.509 certificate. The connection to the
Collecting Process will fail if its certificate was not signed by this CA
(or by a certificate signed by this CA, recursively); this prevents export to
unauthorized Collecting Processes. Required if B<--tls> is present.

=item B<--tls-cert> I<CERT_PEM_FILE>

Use the X.509 certificate in I<CERT_PEM_FILE> to identify this IPFIX Exporting
Process. This certificate should contain the public part of the private key in
I<KEY_PEM_FILE>. Required if B<--tls> is present.

=item B<--tls-key> I<KEY_PEM_FILE>

Use the private key in I<KEY_PEM_FILE> for this IPFIX Exporting Process. This
key should contain the private part of the public key in
I<CERT_PEM_FILE>. Required if B<--tls> is present. If the key is encrypted,
the password must be present in the QOF_TLS_PASS environment variable.

=item B<--observation-domain> I<ODID>

Set observation domain on exported IPFIX messages to I<ODID>; the default is 0.

=item B<--template-refresh> I<TEMPLATE_RTX_TIME>

Set UDP template refresh time in seconds. When set, every active template will
be transmitted each I<TEMPLATE_RTX_TIME> seconds. Defaults to 0 (no template
retransmit) unless B<--ipfix udp> is present, in which case the default is 60
(1 minute).

=back

=head2 Privilege Options

These options are used to cause B<qof> to drop privileges when running as root
for live capture purposes.

=over 4

=item B<--become-user> I<UNPRIVILEGED_USER>

After opening inputs, drop privilege to the named user. Using B<--become-user>
requires B<qof> to be run as root or setuid root. This option will cause all
files written by B<qof> to be owned by the user I<UNPRIVILEGED_USER> and the
user's primary group; use B<--become-group> as well to change the group B<qof>
runs as for output purposes. If running as root for live capture purposes and
B<--become-user> is not present, B<qof> will warn that privilege is not being
dropped. We highly recommend the use of this option, especially in production
environments, for security purposes.

=item B<--become-group> I<UNPRIVILEGED_GROUP>

B<--become-group> can be used to change the group from the default of the user
given in B<--become-user>. This option has no effect if given without the
B<--become-user> option as well.

=back

=head2 Logging Options

These options are used to specify how log messages are routed. B<qof> can
log to standard error, regular files, or the UNIX syslog facility.

=over 4

=item B<--log> I<LOG_SPECIFIER>

Specifies destination for log messages. I<LOG_SPECIFIER> can be a syslog(3)
facility name, the special value B<stderr> for standard error, or the
I<absolute> path to a file for file logging. The default log
specifier is B<stderr> if available, B<user> otherwise.

=item B<--loglevel> I<LOG_LEVEL>

Specify minimum level for logged messages. In increasing levels of verbosity,
the supported log levels are B<quiet>, B<error>, B<critical>, B<warning>,
B<message>, B<info>, and B<debug>. The default logging level is B<warning>.

=item B<--verbose>

Equivalent to B<--loglevel debug>.

=item B<--version>

If present, print version and copyright information to standard error and exit.

=back

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE FORMAT

The behavior of the B<qof> flow table and IPFIX export is defined by a 
YAML configuration file, the path to which is given on the B<qof> 
command line by the B<--yaml> option. If no configuration file is given, it is
as if an empty configuration file is given, and the default value for each 
of the configuration keys is taken.

The YAML configuration file is a mapping of configuration keys to values; 
the configuration keys are as follows:

=over 4

=item B<template>: I<TEMPLATE_LIST>

A list of Information Elements to export. The selection of Information Elements in this Template determines which B<qof> features will be enabled; see the B<OUTPUT> section for details. When no template is given, b<qof> defaults to the following:

=over 2

=item flowStartMilliseconds
=item flowEndMilliseconds
=item octetDeltaCount
=item reverseOctetDeltaCount
=item packetDeltaCount
=item reversePacketDeltaCount
=item sourceIPv4Address
=item destinationIPv4Address
=item sourceIPv6Address
=item destinationIPv6Address
=item sourceTransportPort
=item destinationTransportPort
=item protocolIdentifier
=item flowEndReason

=back

=item B<interface-map>: I<IFMAP_LIST>

This feature will be documented in a future release.

=item B<source-mac>: I<MACADDR_LIST>

This feature will be documented in a future release.

=item B<source-ip>: I<IPADDR_LIST>

This feature will be documented in a future release.

=item B<idle-timeout>: I<IDLE_TIMEOUT>

Set flow idle timeout in seconds. Flows are considered idle and flushed
from the flow table if no packets are received for I<IDLE_TIMEOUT> seconds.
The default flow idle timeout is 30 seconds.

=item B<active-timeout>: I<ACTIVE_TIMEOUT>

Set flow active timeout in seconds. Any flow lasting longer than
I<ACTIVE_TIMEOUT> seconds will be flushed from the flow table.
The default flow active timeout is 300 seconds (5 minutes).

=item B<max-flows>: I<FLOW_TABLE_MAX>

If present, limit the number of open flows in the flow table to
I<FLOW_TABLE_MAX> by prematurely expiring the flows with the least
recently received packets; this is analogous to an adaptive idle
timeout. This option is provided to limit B<qof> resource usage when
operating on data from large networks. By default, there is no flow
table limit, and the flow table can grow to resource exhaustion.

=item B<max-frags>: I<FRAG_TABLE_MAX>

If present, limit the number of outstanding, not-yet reassembled fragments
in the fragment table to I<FRAG_TABLE_MAX> by prematurely expiring fragments
from the table. This option is provided to limit B<qof> resource usage when
operating on data from very large networks or networks with abnormal
fragmentation. The fragment table may exceed this limit slightly due
to limits on how often B<qof> prunes the fragment table (every 5 seconds).
By default, there is no fragment table limit, and the fragment
table can grow to resource exhaustion.

=item B<active-timeout-octets>: I<MAX_FLOW_OCTETS>

Not implemented.

=item B<active-timeout-packets>: I<MAX_FLOW_PACKETS>

Not implemented.

=item B<active-timeout-rtts>: I<MAX_FLOW_PACKETS>

Not implemented.

=item B<active-timeout-rtts>: I<MAX_FLOW_PACKETS>

Not implemented.

=item B<force-biflow>: I<FLAG>

If present and I<FLAG> is anything except "0", export reverse Information 
Elements for all flows, even those with only one observed direction.

=item B<gre-decap>: I<FLAG>

If present and I<FLAG> is anything except "0", 
attempt to decode GRE version 0 encapsulated packets. Flows will
be created from packets within the GRE tunnels. Undecodeable GRE packets will
be dropped. Without this option, GRE traffic is exported as IP protocol 47
flows. This option is presently experimental.

=item B<silk-compatible>: I<FLAG>

If present and I<FLAG> is anything except "0",
export flows in "SiLK mode". This flag must be used when
exporting to SiLK for it to collect TCP flow information.  
This also introduces the following incompatibilities
with standard IPFIX export:

=over 4

=item *

octetDeltaCount and reverseOctetDeltaCount are clamped to 32 bits. Any packet
that would cause either of these counters to overflow 32 bits will cause the
flow to close with flowEndReason 0x02 (active timeout), and will become the
first packet of a new flow. This is analogous to forcing an active timeout
when the octet counters overflow.

=item *

The high-order bit of the flowEndReason IE is set on any flow created on a
counter overflow, as above.

=item *

The high-order bit of the flowEndReason IE is set on any flow created on an
active timeout.

=back

Since this changes the semantics of the exported flowEndReason IE, it should
only be used when generating flows and exporting to rwflowpack, flowcap, or
writing files for processing with rwipfix2silk.

=back 

=head1 OUTPUT X<OUTPUT>

[NOTE: Documentation rewrite is in progress from this point.]

[TODO frontmatter]

=head2 Flow Records

B<qof>'s output consists of an IPFIX message stream. B<qof> uses a variety of
templates for IPFIX data records. For further information about IPFIX as implemented by B<qof>, see RFC 7011, RFC 7012, RFC 5103, and RFC 5655.

B<qof> assigns information element numbers to reverse flow elements in biflow
capture based on the standard IPFIX PEN 29305. This applies only for
information elements registered with IANA that do not have a reverse
information element already defined. B<qof> additionally uses information
elements registered with CERT (PEN 6871) for features inherited from B<yaf> and
elements registered under the trammell.ch PEN (PEN 35566) for B<qof> specific
features. For enterprise-specific information elements, the method described in
RFC 5103 is used to calculate their reverse element identifier: bit fourteen is
set to one in the IE field, (e.g. 16384 + the forward IE number.)

B<qof> supports the following Information Elements in flow records, which can appear in the B<template:> list in the YAML configuration file; in the list below, features enabled and conditions for export for each Information Element are noted.

B<qof> responds to B<SIGINT> or B<SIGTERM> by terminating input processing,
flushing any pending flows to the current output, and exiting. If B<--verbose>
is given, B<qof> responds to B<SIGUSR1> by printing present flow and fragment table
statistics to its log.  All other signals are handled by the C runtimes in
the default manner on the platform on which B<qof> is currently operating.

=head1 EXAMPLES

To generate flows from an pcap file into an IPFIX file:

C<yaf --in packets.pcap --out flows.yaf>

To capture flows from a pcap interface and export them to files in the
current directory rotated hourly:

C<yaf --live pcap --in en1 --out en1_capture --rotate 3600>

To capture flows from an Endace DAG card and export them via IPFIX over TCP:

C<yaf --live dag --in dag0 --ipfix tcp --out my-collector.example.com>

=head1 KNOWN ISSUES

YAF BPF Filtering does not operate with the Bivio Zero-Copy Library.

YAF BPF Filtering is ignored when using B<--live> I<dag> or I<napatech>
because libpcap is not used.

YAF PCAP Export options are ignored when using B<--live> I<dag> or I<napatech>.

YAF 2.x requires libfixbuf 1.0.0 or later.

YAF 2.0 will not interoperate with the SiLK tools unless B<--silk> is used, due
to the TCP Information Elements being nested in the subTemplateMultiList.
YAF 2.0 must be used with an IPFIX Collecting Process that can handle IPFIX lists elements, especially the subTemplateMultiList Information Element in order to retrieve certain flow information.  Older versions of YAF can read YAF 2.0 flow files, but will ignore anything contained in the subTemplateMultiList.

The plugin infrastructure has been modified in YAF 2.0 to export templates
in YAF's subTemplateMultiList element.

YAF 2.0 will export statistics in an Options Template and Options Data Records
unless the B<--no-stats> switch is given.  The IPFIX Collecting Process should be
able to differentiate between options records and flow records in order to
prevent incorrect transcoding of statistics records into flow records.

YAF will not rotate output files if it is not seeing any flow data.  However,
it will continue to write process statistics messages at the configured
interval time to the most recent output file.

Presently, the B<destinationTransportPort> information element contains
ICMP type and code information for ICMP or ICMP6 flows; this is nonstandard
and may not be interoperable with other IPFIX implementations.
